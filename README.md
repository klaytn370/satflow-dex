# SatFlow DEX

SatFlow DEX is a minimal but proper AMM-based decentralized exchange built on **OP_NET (Bitcoin Layer 1)**.  
It uses the **constant product formula (x * y = k)** to enable trust-minimized swaps between two OP20 tokens.

This project is built with the help of **Bob (OP_NET MCP)** and **OpenClaw** as part of the **OP_NET Vibecoding Challenge**.
